# ðŸŽ® Video Game Sales Case Study

### **About this dataset**

This dataset provides detailed information on video games that have sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide, compiled from a scrape of VGChartz.com. Each entry includes the gameâ€™s name, platform of release, year of release, genre, and publisher, along with sales figures broken down by region. Sales are reported in millions of units for North America (NA_Sales), Europe (EU_Sales), Japan (JP_Sales), and other regions (Other_Sales), with a calculated global total (Global_Sales). The dataset also assigns an overall sales rank to each game, making it useful for analyzing industry trends, comparing regional preferences, and identifying the top-performing platforms, genres, and publishers over time.

## Research Question 1  
**Which year had the highest global video game sales?**

**SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT CAST(Year AS INT) AS Year,
       SUM(Global_Sales) AS Total_Global_Sales
FROM vgsales
WHERE Year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CAST(Year AS INT)
ORDER BY Total_Global_Sales DESC;
```

**Steps:**

1. Use **CAST(Year AS INT)** to convert the year into an integer for cleaner grouping.
2. Use **SUM(Global_Sales)** to calculate total global sales (in millions) for each year.
3. Multiply by **1,000,000** to convert sales from millions into full units.
4. Use **FORMAT(..., 'N0')** to add commas and remove decimals for readability.
5. Exclude rows with missing years using **WHERE Year IS NOT NULL**.
6. Apply **GROUP BY Year** so totals are calculated per year.
7. Use **ORDER BY SUM(Global_Sales) DESC** to sort years from highest to lowest sales.
   
**Answer**

2008 had the highest global video game sales, with about 43.23 billion units sold.
